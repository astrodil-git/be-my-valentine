Put your images in this folder with these exact names:

  photo.jpg        → main 4×6 photo
  filmstrip1.jpg   → first filmstrip
  filmstrip2.jpg   → second filmstrip
  filmstrip3.jpg   → third filmstrip

Optional (surprise after all items are clicked):
  video.mp4        → video that slides in and plays (or video.mov / video.webm)

Use .jpg (or .jpeg) for images. The app loads these paths so it runs the same every time.
See the main README.md in the parent folder for how to share the app (e.g. GitHub Pages).
